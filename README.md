## 🎃 SENG 365 Halloween Store Website

This project is an ongoing Halloween store website developed throughout a series of labs for SENG 365, a client-side web development course at UNCW. 

📌**Note:** This project is still in progress. Updates will be made as labs are completed. 

## 🛠️ Technologies:

- **HTML** for structuring the web pages
- **CSS** for styling layouts, colors, and responsiveness
- **Javascript** for making the pages interactive
- **Visual Studio Code** as the development environment
- **GitHub** for version control

## 📝 Labs:
Each lab introduces new concepts and features, building towards a fully functional website:

- **Lab 1:** Create the [Home Page](#home-page) (HTML structure)
- **Lab 2:** Apply external CSS to format the [Home Page](#home-page)
- **Lab 3:** Add spacing, borders, and background using the CSS box model
- **Lab 4:** Implement Flexbox for a 2-column layout & horizontal navigation bar
- **Lab 5:** Add dropdown navigation (2nd-tier menu)
- **Lab 6:** Create the [Props Page](#props-page) with product listings and links
